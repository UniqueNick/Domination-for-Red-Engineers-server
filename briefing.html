    <br><br><br>
    The enemy are the US troops.<br>
    You have to free the island from all enemy forces.<br>
    To clear a target kill almost all enemies, destroy the radio tower at the main target and solve the main target
    sidemission.<br>
    <br><br>There are many (more 50) several side missions available that will get you some extra very good land
    vehicles if you solve them.
    <br><br>
    Once a main target is clear, a flag is created in a random place from where you can jump with the HALO parajump
    script.
    <br><br>
    You can transport many vehicles with your Mi17 choppers, except heavy vehicles like M1, T72, Shilka, BMP (MHQ BMP is
    allowed to fly) etc.<br><br>
    The MHQ BMPs are your mobile respawn points.<br>
    You can drop an ammo crate if you are the driver of a MHQ BMP or the pilot of a helicopter (but you have to load a
    crate at base)!<br>
    The maximum number of ammo crates simultaneously is 6. An ammo crate gets only deleted if the crate was
    destroyed.<br>
    Reload a crate into chopper 1,2,3 or W or in one of the MHQs, otherwise you will end up at the next target without
    any crate.
    <br><br>
    The engineers can repair and refuel all vehicles and aircraft. <br>
    That only works once if no salvage truck or repair truck is near an engineer (reload and refuel capability can get
    restored at base).
    Engineers can also load static weapons like D30, DSHKM, etc, in Ural salvage trucks, and unload them wherever they
    want.
    Engineers are also able to flip tanks that are lying upside down when they have ANY repair truck near them.
    <br><br>
    The flag at your base can be used as a teleporter to your mobile respawns or you can choose parajump there (if
    enabled by admin).
    <BR><BR>
    If a vehicle that you've won for solving a sidemission or clearing a main target gets destroyed you can transport
    the wreck with chopper 4 (W) to the wreck repair point at your base and you'll get a new one. But only man with some
    rank can do this!<br>
    Chopper 4 (W) can only transport wrecks, nothing else. Height for wreck pick-up is >= 2.5 meters.
    <BR><BR>
    The artillery operators can fire artillery strikes about every six minutes. They are also able to rescue hostages.
    You have to bring the hostages to the <a href="marker:teleporter">flag</a> at your base.
    <BR><BR>
    The leaders of team Alpha or team Charlie (alpha_1 and charlie_1) can call in air drop. A chopper will bring an
    artillery cannon or a vehicle or a ammobox.
    <BR><BR>
    MG Gunners can place MG nests, medics can place mashs.
    <BR><BR>
    If you have the freelook bug/headbug press the "Fix Headbug" button in the status dialog (available at mobile
    respawn) to fix this annoying bug.
    <br>
    You can also change the viewdistance and other settings in the STATUS dialog, just press one of the buttons.
    <br><br>
    It is also possible to put the primary weapon in your backpack. You are then able to take another primary weapon and
    switch between the weapon in the backpack and the currently selected weapon.
    <br>The night on the Sahrni is rather short, and night is skipped from 21:00 to 03:00!<br><br>
    Additional information.<br>
    The conditions of the liberation of the city, captured by the enemy for the first time: in a square having a side of
    350 meters in the city centre should be no more than 5 enemy soldiers, no tanks and not more than one car<br>
    The conditions for the exemption of any occupied city: needs to stay alive and in good condition enemy soldiers and
    armored vehicles to the total number of not more than 5. The distance doesn't matter.<br><br>
    Mandatory rules of this server:<br>
    a) one of the MHQ (Rep. of) should always stay on the base,<br>
    b) Always give back transport Mi-17 with numbers 1 and 2 on the base after use,<br>
    b) don't use this server as a training camp! You and we all be satisfied with it!<br><br>
    Mission by Xeno. Modified for R-E by Fitz/Engineer ACE/Dupa/Agent/Rokse<BR><BR>
    Uses KillJoys weather script (enhanced), ManDays HALO parajump script (enhanced), load/unload scripts (enhanced)
    from -eutf-Myke, norrins revive scripts, Dr.Eyeball's Teamstatus Dialog, KRON_Strings from Kronzky, ROMMEL's
    suppresive scripts, Mandos parachute and heliroute and animated letters from BIS.<br>
    (All those scripts are heavily modified).

    01 August 1985, 8 a.m.</h1><br>
    A dark menace looms to the peace and prosperity people of the planet. Moneybags of US, driven by thirst of the world
    domination, developed an occupation plan of little independent island Sahrani. Using their agent codenamed "Lawyer"
    - high ranked member of Soviet Union Communist Party Central Commitee, they planning to avoid involvement of Soviet
    Army in this conflict. Both those facts didn't escape of russian intellingence agent vigilant eye.<br>

    Information consealment for the Sahrani invasion is supposed to be conducted by means of mass media (newspapers,
    magazines, radio, television, internet). Main bulk of information will be spreaded by "The Wall Street Journal",
    "Daily Telegraph" and "Playboy" magazine. Russian spy report also contains blueprints of some device codenamed
    "Mahleinrichtung". Accordingly to technical department staff opinion this device is kind of high-power emitter of
    unknown type radiation. It also has fastenings widely used for mounting on urban telecommunication towers.<br>

    Immediatelly this information was sent to agent supervisor. Considering high probability of having traitors among
    higher staff and in order to exclude probability of red tape by high ranking officers it was decided to try to
    destroy FRS-CIA plans by own means.<br>

    By secret meeting of mankind-minded intelligence officers it was decided to counteract to evil plans of the enemies
    of mankind and peace. This only could be carried out with help of international volunteers, ready to sacrifice
    yourself to the humanity future cause.<br>

    So, you have been informed by your friends about marvelous hunting and fishing taken place on tropical island in
    Atlantic, and that's why you have left your military service to enjoy this opportunity.Scratching your ass after
    heavy parachute landing and listening to brief lecture, given to you by scary man in military outfit you soon
    realise, that ticket back could be earned only by arranging meeting between unfriendly US army fellows and their
    creator.<br>

    Government of Sahrani operating in underground cooperates with us, despite of nobody seen them or their people.<br>
    (Here follows untranslatable piece of russian poetry.)<br>

    Us free willingly arrived to this island by call of heart or by mind effort will decide the future of the peace on
    Earth!<br>

    P.S. While being at island You will be carrying chevron with kinda "whothehellknowswhatthatmeans" sign, possibly
    related to some kind of military group. Being captured you shoud spit to enemy face while smiling mocking smile. Do
    not ask me why!(I don't know it either...)<br>
